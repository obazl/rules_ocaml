**WARNING** Not yet fully supported - subject to change. Use with caution.

An `ocaml_library` is a collection of modules packaged into an OBazl
target; it is not a single binary file. It is a OBazl convenience rule
that allows a target to depend on a collection of deps under a single
label, rather than having to list each individually.

Be careful not to confuse `ocaml_library` with `ocaml_archive`. The
latter generates OCaml binaries (`.cma`, `.cmxa`, '.a' archive files);
the former does not generate anything, it just passes on its
dependencies under a single label, packaged in a
[OcamlLibraryMarker](providers_ocaml.md#ocamllibraryprovider). For
more information see [Collections: Libraries, Archives and
Packages](../ug/collections.md).
